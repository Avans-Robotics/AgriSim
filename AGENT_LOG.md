## 2026-09-30 Reset main and start fresh branch
### Goal & outcome
Clean local main and start the project from scratch. Local main now matches origin/main (LICENSE only); new branch feat/fresh-start created from it.
### Decisions & why
- Old local main (bb04a4c) had unrelated history to origin/main and only a toy corn field prototype; discarded via hard reset.
- No archive tag: bb04a4c is the parent of fix/field-freeze-makefile, which still preserves the old work locally and on origin.
- Uncommitted CLAUDE.md edits dropped; CLAUDE.md to be rewritten during new project design.
### Lessons / gotchas
- Old CLAUDE.md referenced 'omni.physx.graph.nodes.PPointInstancer', which does not look like a real API; UsdGeom.PointInstancer is the real instancing prim.
- Old .gitignore listed sim/*.py files that were committed anyway, so the ignore had no effect.
### State
Branch feat/fresh-start at ce39370, clean tree. Validated via git status/log. Not pushed (user pushes).
### Open items
- Decide whether to delete fix/field-freeze-makefile (local + remote).
- Design new project structure and CLAUDE.md.

## 2026-09-30 Design phase M0: spec, ADRs, glossary, repo structure
### Goal & outcome
Capture the agreed design for the pixel farming field generator as docs before any code. Written: docs/design/spec.md, CONTEXT.md, ADRs 0001-0006, docs/research/prior-art.md, README.md, new CLAUDE.md, folder skeleton with a README per folder.
### Decisions & why
- Simulator-agnostic core plus per-simulator Exporters; Gazebo Harmonic + Jazzy target, Docker for distribution (installed, recommended pairing).
- Committed Asset Library of Variants reused per Plant: VRAM budget and students need no generator toolchain.
- CropCraft used as asset source only: row-based, Blender runtime, Gazebo Classic, no carrots or physics.
- Dataset rendering separated from closed-loop sim: Gazebo cannot reach path-traced quality; Blender Exporter later.
- Pull-out via custom force-threshold system + DetachableJoint (ADR 0006 proposed, settled in M4).
### Lessons / gotchas
- CropCraft paper images are Blender renders, not Gazebo; do not expect that look in Gazebo.
- Repo LICENSE is AGPL-3.0; Apache-2.0 CropCraft assets may be included. License choice listed as open question.
- `gz sim` broken locally: ROS-vendored gz shadows system gz on PATH.
### State
Branch feat/fresh-start. Docs only, no code; links checked. Uncommitted except this log.
### Open items
- Resolve the 13 open questions in spec section 12 (camera model, carrot planting defaults, license, name, ...).
- Then start M1 on IMPLEMENT.

## 2026-09-30 M1a: core Field Spec to Manifest, SVG view
### Goal & outcome
M1a chunk: repo tooling (uv, ruff, pytest, GitHub Actions CI) and core. `pixelfield build examples/carrot_pixel.yaml` writes manifest.json and field.svg (32 of 33 carrot positions planted, 3 east-west rows). 12 tests pass, ruff clean.
### Decisions & why
- SVG writer is an Exporter (`EXPORTERS["svg"]`): exercises the extension point now, keeps rendering out of core.
- One RNG per Pixel seeded with "seed:row:col": editing one Pixel leaves all other Plants identical.
- All random draws happen for every nominal position, missing or not: ids (position index) and values stay stable.
- Rows are centred in the Pixel and clipped to the margin-inset square; jittered positions are clamped to it (ponytail note in layout.py).
- Random mode and path_gap raise a clear "planned for M2" error instead of being silently ignored.
- Only runtime dependency: pyyaml; stdlib random, argparse.
### Lessons / gotchas
- ROS Jazzy puts /opt/ros/jazzy site-packages on PYTHONPATH; their pytest11 plugins (launch_testing etc.) break collection. Fixed with `addopts = "--disable-plugin-autoload"` in pyproject.
- uv was not installed; user installed it via the official script (~/.local/bin).
### State
Branch m1a-core, commit 1e0c73a, not pushed. Validated: tests, lint, CLI run, SVG rendered and inspected (single Pixel and a rotated 2x2 grid). CI workflow UNVERIFIED until pushed to GitHub.
### Open items
- Push m1a-core and check the CI run; user reviews and merges.
- Next chunk M1b: fix local gz PATH, Gazebo Exporter with soil plane and primitive Plants.

## 2026-10-01 M1a: second Crop (lettuce) to prove crop-generic core
### Goal & outcome
Check that adding a Crop needs no code change. Added crops/lettuce.yaml (placeholder values), examples/mixed.yaml (2x3 grid, carrot, lettuce, empty) and a two-Crop test. Only code change: SVG colors Plants per Crop. 13 tests pass; mixed build gives 76 Plants and the SVG matches the grid.
### Decisions & why
- Lettuce added on m1a-core (not yet merged) because it validates M1a's crop-generic claim; values are guesses, marked provisional in the file.
- Lettuce: 0.25 m spacing, 0.125 m margin, 4 heads per 0.5 m Pixel.
### Lessons / gotchas
- Per-Pixel seeding visibly works: Pixel r0c0 in mixed.yaml is identical to carrot_pixel.yaml (same seed).
### State
Branch m1a-core, validated (tests, lint, CLI, rendered SVG inspected). Not pushed; CI UNVERIFIED.
### Open items
- Replace lettuce values with measured ones (spec section 12, open item 2).
- Push, CI check, review and merge; then M1b.

## 2026-10-01 M1a: legend in the SVG view
### Goal & outcome
field.svg now has a legend strip below the Field: one entry per Crop with its Plant count, an Empty Pixel swatch (only when present) and a scale bar. Rendered for carrot_pixel and mixed; 13 tests pass.
### Decisions & why
- Legend below the Field (user choice), so no Plants are covered.
- Scale bar 10 cm instead of the proposed 0.5 m: 0.5 m equals the full width of a one-Pixel image.
- Entries wrap to a new line on narrow Fields; text width estimated at 8 px per character (ponytail note).
### Lessons / gotchas
- Legend circles are self-closing, Plant circles have a <title> child: tests count "</circle>" to count Plants only.
### State
Branch m1a-core, validated (tests, lint, both SVGs rendered and inspected). Not pushed; CI UNVERIFIED.
### Open items
- Push, CI check, review and merge; then M1b.

## 2026-10-01 M1a: coordinate frame and 10 cm grid in the SVG view
### Goal & outcome
field.svg now shows the Field frame at the origin (x east red, y north green, 10 cm arrows) and a light grid every 10 cm from the origin. Legend label reads "10 cm (grid)". Rendered for carrot_pixel and mixed; 13 tests pass.
### Decisions & why
- No axis tick labels (user choice): frame plus grid is enough to count positions.
- Grid spacing and scale bar share one constant (GRID_M) so they cannot drift apart.
- Grid lines on Pixel edges are skipped so the darker Pixel outlines stay visible.
- 20 px white border via a negative viewBox origin: field coordinates in the SVG are unchanged.
### Lessons / gotchas
- A frame drawn exactly on the image edge is half clipped; the first render showed only half of the y axis. Always render and look.
- Green label on brown soil is unreadable; axis labels sit in the white border or use the axis color on a contrasting area.
### State
Branch m1a-core, validated (tests, lint, both SVGs rendered and inspected). Not pushed; CI UNVERIFIED.
### Open items
- Push, CI check, review and merge; then M1b.

## 2026-10-01 M1b: fix local gz (GZ_CONFIG_PATH, not PATH)
### Goal & outcome
Make `gz sim` work locally. Root cause: sourcing ROS Jazzy sets GZ_CONFIG_PATH to /opt/ros/jazzy/opt/sdformat_vendor/share/gz only, so gz sees just `sdf`. Fixed by appending /usr/share/gz in ~/.bashrc (backup at ~/.bashrc.bak-gzconfig). CLAUDE.md known issue rewritten.
### Decisions & why
- Fix lives in ~/.bashrc, not the repo: machine issue; Docker (M1e) covers other users.
- Keep gz-transport15/msgs12 (user-installed 2026-02-01 via python3-gz-transport15, may serve another project); workaround `--force-version 13` documented.
- ros-jazzy-ros-gz deferred until a chunk needs ROS topics.
### Lessons / gotchas
- The PATH theory was wrong: vendor gz and /usr/bin/gz behave identically; the gz tools discover commands via *.yaml in GZ_CONFIG_PATH.
- `gz topic --versions` lists 15.1.0 and 13.5.0; default may pick 15, incompatible with Harmonic.
### State
Branch m1b-gazebo. Validated in fresh `bash -i`: gz sim 8.14.0, gz sdf 14.9.0, `gz sdf -k` on stock shapes.sdf Valid. GUI open of shapes.sdf UNVERIFIED (user checks by eye).
### Open items
- User: run `gz sim shapes.sdf` in a new terminal, confirm GUI.
- Next: Gazebo Exporter with soil plane and primitive Plants (grill first).

## 2026-10-01 M1b: silence gz protobuf errors and EGL warnings
### Goal & outcome
`gz sim shapes.sdf` worked but printed hundreds of `libprotobuf ERROR ... File already exists` lines plus libEGL dri2 warnings. Protobuf errors fixed by removing the gz-msgs12/transport15 stack (user ran apt). EGL: `__EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_FILENAMES` set to NVIDIA only in ~/.bashrc. CLAUDE.md known issues updated.
### Decisions & why
- Removed the stack instead of dpkg-diverting the desc file: its only user (DroneBalloonProto, PX4 camera scripts, last touched 2026-02-01) is obsolete per user.
- Explicit `apt remove libgz-msgs12 libgz-utils4 libzenohc`, no `apt autoremove`: autoremove would also drop the unrelated ros-jazzy-hpp-fcl.
### Lessons / gotchas
- gz-msgs loads every *.gz_desc in /usr/share/gz/protos; two major versions there means duplicate descriptors in every gz process.
- GZ_DESCRIPTOR_PATH is additive: pointing it at a msgs10-only dir doubled the errors (220 to 432).
### State
Branch m1b-gazebo. Validated in fresh `bash -i`: 0 protobuf errors in headless `gz sim -s` and `gz topic -l` (was 220 and 440), gz sim 8.14.0, only transport 13.5.0 left. EGL fix validated: user opened the GUI, shapes render, no warnings.
### Open items
None for the gz setup.
- Next: grill the Gazebo Exporter (soil plane, primitive Plants).

## 2026-10-01 M1b: Gazebo Exporter with soil and stand-in Plants
### Goal & outcome
`pixelfield build` now also writes world.sdf: flat brown soil (Field plus 0.5 m border, 2 cm box, top at z=0, with collision), a directional sun, Physics/UserCommands/SceneBroadcaster systems, and one static cylinder model per Plant named by Plant id. 17 tests pass; both examples pass `gz sdf -k` and load headless without warnings.
### Decisions & why
- One world.sdf with inline Plant models, no per-Crop model.sdf + include: `<include>` cannot scale, and every Plant has its own scale. Modularity lives in the shared Variant .glb files (M1d).
- Stand-in size derived, no YAML field: radius 0.4 x min(row_spacing, in_row_spacing), height 0.1 m, both times Plant scale. Thrown away in M1d.
- Visual only on Plants; collision comes with Variants.
- FieldLayout gained `crops` (deviation, reported): Exporters need the Planting Pattern and only receive the Layout.
- Plant colors moved to exporters/colors.py so SVG and Gazebo match.
- build runs all Exporters by default; `--exporter` picks one.
- SDF written with stdlib ElementTree (escaping, ET.indent, tests parse with the same module).
### Lessons / gotchas
- The gz sdf test is skipped only when gz is absent; with gz present but GZ_CONFIG_PATH unfixed it fails (intended, it flags the broken setup).
### State
Branch m1b-gazebo, commit 2c5b0ec. Validated: pytest (17), ruff, build + `gz sdf -k` on carrot_pixel and mixed, headless `gz sim -s` load clean, user checked both worlds in the GUI (stand-in sizes differ from the SVG dots, accepted: both are throwaway).
### Open items
- Push m1b-gazebo, CI check, review and merge. Then M1c (carrot Asset Generator).

## 2026-10-01 M1c checkpoint 1: carrot root Variants
### Goal & outcome
`pixelfield generate carrot` writes 24 root-only carrot Variants (glb, about 16 KB each, 760 triangles), `variants.json` with root sizes, and a Gazebo preview world (`out/carrot_variants/world.sdf`). 21 tests pass.
### Decisions & why
- Grilled: harvest stage only; real mesh leaflets (checkpoint 2); one PBR material per part, no textures; trimesh as optional `generate` extra plus dev group; collision sizes in variants.json now (only the generator knows them); at most 3k triangles per Variant; Variant files are spec-correct y-up, any Gazebo rotation goes in the Exporter (M1d).
- Variant count and library path come from the Crop YAML (Crop gained `library`).
- Preview world lives in exporters/gazebo (`preview`), keeping simulator code out of generators.
- Root = solid of revolution (flat crown, rounded edge, Nantes-like taper) with a small sideways bend.
### Lessons / gotchas
- trimesh `fix_normals` needs scipy; instead the revolve profile runs tip to crown so the volume is positive (normals outward). A test asserts it.
- trimesh names glb meshes `geometry_0` unless `geom_name` is passed.
- The agent shell lacks ~/.bashrc; gz commands need `bash -ic`.
- Headless `gz sim -s` does not load visual meshes, so it does not prove the glb renders.
### State
Branch m1c-carrot. Validated: pytest (21), ruff, determinism (same md5 across runs), `gz sdf -k` on the preview world, build still works without trimesh. GUI look in gz UNVERIFIED (user checks, including whether gz shows the y-up glb standing or lying).
### Open items
- User: `gz sim out/carrot_variants/world.sdf`, judge shape and orientation.
- Checkpoint 2: foliage.

## 2026-10-01 M1c: y-up Variants stood up in Gazebo
### Goal & outcome
User saw the preview carrots lying on their side: Gazebo loads glTF without converting y up to z up (confirms the Q10 expectation). The Gazebo code now puts a roll of +90 degrees on each Variant visual (`GLTF_TO_Z_UP`), so the preview stands them up; M1d reuses it.
### Decisions & why
- Roll on the visual pose, not the model pose: the model frame stays z up with yaw only, so M1d Plant poses need no change.
- Moved forward from M1d (user approved) so foliage can be judged upright at checkpoint 2.
### Lessons / gotchas
None.
### State
Branch m1c-carrot. Validated: pytest (21), ruff, `gz sdf -k`. Upright look in the GUI UNVERIFIED (user checks). User judged the root shape fine.
### Open items
- Checkpoint 2: foliage.

## 2026-10-01 M1c checkpoint 2: carrot foliage
### Goal & outcome
Carrot Variants now have 6-10 leaves: a tapered 3-sided petiole tube along a quadratic Bezier (up, out, slight droop) and 4-6 leaflet pairs plus a tip leaflet, each a fan of 3-5 diamond blades. At most about 2,000 triangles per Variant, library 1.2 MB. `variants.json` gained `foliage.height` and `foliage.radius`, measured from the mesh.
### Decisions & why
- Double-sided glTF material on foliage instead of duplicated back faces: halves the triangles, and gz-common reads assimp's `$mat.twosided` (found in libgz-common5-graphics).
- Blades are flipped to face up so the single faces light correctly from above.
- Foliage sizes measured from the vertices, not from the sampled parameters, so collision shapes match the mesh.
### Lessons / gotchas
- `uv run --with matplotlib` gives a quick off-repo render to look at meshes before asking the user, with no project dependency change.
### State
Branch m1c-carrot. Validated: pytest (21), ruff, `gz sdf -k`, matplotlib render of three Variants looked like carrots. User checked the leaves in the gz GUI and approved them ("perfect for now").
### Open items
- Push m1c-carrot, PR, CI, review and merge. Then M1d.

## 2026-10-01 M1d checkpoint 1: Plants use carrot Variants
### Goal & outcome
Grilled M1d into 4 checkpoints (Variants, lighting, soil texture, cameras + `pixelfield render`). Checkpoint 1 done: the Gazebo Exporter gives each Plant its Variant glb (relative URI `meshes/<variant>.glb`, glTF roll, uniform Plant scale, yaw), copying the used glbs into `out/<name>/meshes/`. Crops without Variants (lettuce) keep the cylinder stand-in.
### Decisions & why
- Self-contained out dir with relative mesh URIs: relocatable and Docker-friendly (M1e); gz resolves relative mesh URIs against the world file (tested).
- Visual only, no collision: Plants are static until M4.
- hue_shift ignored in Gazebo (ponytail note): glb materials cannot be tinted per Plant without replacing them.
- Rest of M1d agreed: one world.sdf holding cameras (top-down + 45 deg oblique, 1920x1080, hfov 60 deg), VCT GI in the Sensors plugin (32^3), sun about 40 deg elevation from SE plus sky, one approved ambientCG 1K soil set, `pixelfield render` running from the out dir.
### Lessons / gotchas
- VCT GI is not SDF scene syntax: it is a `<global_illumination type="vct">` block inside the Sensors system plugin and only affects camera sensors (GUI needs the separate GlobalIlluminationVct plugin). Example: /usr/share/gz/gz-sim8/worlds/global_illumination.sdf.
- A gz camera sensor saves no images unless something subscribes to its topic (`gz topic -e -t /camera` alongside works).
- A relative camera `<save><path>` resolves against the cwd, not the world file.
- Headless runs need a few thousand iterations; at 200 the run ends before the render thread produces a frame.
### State
Branch m1d-variants, uncommitted code. Validated: pytest (21), ruff, `gz sdf -k` on carrot_pixel and mixed, headless camera snapshot shows 32 upright carrots with shoulders above the soil. GUI look UNVERIFIED (user checks).
### Open items
- User: `gz sim out/carrot_pixel/world.sdf`. Then checkpoint 2 (lighting).

## 2026-10-01 M1d checkpoint 2: lighting
### Goal & outcome
world.sdf now has the Sensors system (ogre2) with VCT global illumination (32^3, 6 bounces, other values from gz-sim's example world), a `<scene>` with sky, ambient 0.4 and no grid, and the sun at 40 degrees elevation from the south-east (constants `SUN_ELEVATION`, `SUN_AZIMUTH`, `GI_RESOLUTION`, `GI_BOUNCES`).
### Decisions & why
- GI lives in world.sdf (Sensors plugin), not a separate render world: cameras (checkpoint 4) pick it up, and the GUI ignores it.
- No custom `<gui>` block for the GUI GI plugin: it would replace gz's default GUI layout.
### Lessons / gotchas
- At 32^3 GI on one Pixel the effect is subtle (lighter canopy interior and stems); compare against a no-GI render to see it.
### State
Branch m1d-variants, uncommitted code. Validated: pytest (22), ruff, `gz sdf -k`, headless GI and no-GI renders with 0 errors. GUI sky look UNVERIFIED (user checks).
### Open items
- Tune ambient/sun intensity by eye once the soil texture and real cameras are in.
- Next: checkpoint 3 (soil texture, user approves the ambientCG set).

## 2026-10-01 M1d checkpoint 3: soil texture
### Goal & outcome
Soil uses ambientCG Ground048 (CC0, 1K JPG color, NormalGL, roughness; about 5 MB) from `assets/library/textures/soil/`, copied into `out/<name>/textures/` and referenced relatively in a PBR material. Commit f3ebcdd.
### Decisions & why
- User picked Ground048 (dark crumbly soil, like a loosened bed) from six ambientCG candidates; swapping later is a one-folder change.
- NormalGL, not NormalDX: OGRE uses the OpenGL normal convention.
- Soil visual = grid of 1 m box tiles (`SOIL_TILE`) over one collision box: SDF boxes map the texture once per face, so one big box would stretch it.
### Lessons / gotchas
- Relative PBR map paths also resolve against the world file (render run from /tmp worked).
### State
Branch m1d-variants. Validated: pytest (23), ruff, `gz sdf -k`, headless oblique and top-down renders show textured soil without visible tile seams.
### Open items
- Next: checkpoint 4 (cameras + `pixelfield render`).
